# Data Science Salaries Analysis 2020-2024

**Overview** - In the rapidly evolving field of data science, understanding the trends and patterns in salaries is crucial for professionals and organizations alike.  This dataset aims to shed light on the landscape of Data Science Salaries from 2020 to 2024.  By analyzing salary data over this period, data enthusiasts, researchers, and industry professionals can gain valuable insights into salary trends, regional variations, and potential factors incluending compensentation within the data science community.

**Process** - To review the code, select "7 Branches" in GitHub. Choose one of the branches, and open Data Science Salaries.ipynb file in a source code editor that supports Jupyter Notebook. I recommend using Google Colab. Each cell has code that displays an output below the individual cell. Use the play button outside the top left corner of each cell to run each cell. You can also click inside the cell and press Shift + Enter to run the cell and move down to the next cell. The output of each cell displays what the comment requests and uses the Pandas Library of the Python coding language.

**Dataset Structure** - The dataset "data_science_salaries" covering the period 2020 to 2024 includes the following columns:
- Job Title: Data Engineer, Data Scientist, Data Mgmt. Specialist, etc.
- Experience: Exective-level, Mid-level, Senior-level and Entry-level
- Employment Type: Full-time, Part-time, Contract and Freelance
- Work Models: Hybrid, Remote and On-site
- Work Year: 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024
- Employee Residence: Data is Represented for 87 Countries
- Salary
- Salary Currency
- Salary in USD
- Company Location: Data is Represented for 87 Countries
- Company Size: Small, Medium and Large
    
**Conclusion** - Although the dataset was determined to be very insightful, it did prove to have some limitations including incomplete salary data in 2024.  In addition, in reference to the company size parameters i.e. small, medium and large, it would have been more insightful if the company size included i.e. revenue in dollars as a means to measure the relevant company size.  Also, another limiation appears to relate to a large number of company locations with singular or very small collection of data points, thus resutling in skewed data analysis.  Overall, based on our analysis of the salary trends, we determined that the future of the data science community is very promising.  It was also determined that both on-site and remote positions will continue to grow into 2025, with on-site outnumbering remote 2:1 with approximately $20K in median pay.
